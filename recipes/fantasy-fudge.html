        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This fantasy fudge recipe is straight from the label of a well-known brand of marshmallow creme.<br>
            After some time, the company changed the recipe, but this is the original way to make smooth chocolate<br>
            and marshmallow fudge with walnuts. This big-batch recipe makes 3 pounds of sweet fudge—perfect for<br>
            gifting to friends and family during the holidays.<br>
        </p>

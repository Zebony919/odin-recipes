        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This festive Christmas cake is made with dried fruits and candied citrus peel soaked in brandy to add <br>
            flavor and make a rich, moist fruitcake for Christmas. Delicious as-is or cover it with almond paste <br>
            and royal icing. I remember my mother storing her fruitcake in an old butter churn that belonged to my <br>
            grandmother and great-grandmother... I wish I still had that old crock!<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Combine candied cherries, citrus peel, and almonds in a medium bowl. Add raisins, currants, <br>
                and dates; pour in brandy and stir to combine. Cover and let sit for 2 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Grease a deep 8-inch <br>
                fruitcake pan, line it with parchment paper, and grease again.
            </li>
            <li>Dredge brandy-soaked fruit with 1/2 cup flour.</li>
            <li>Whisk together remaining 2 cups flour, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in <br>
                a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir molasses and apple juice together in a separate bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Cream butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually blend in brown sugar and eggs.</li>
            <li>Add flour mixture in 4 batches, alternating with molasses mixture.</li>
            <li>Fold in floured fruit, then turn batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out <br>
                clean, 3 to 3 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove cake from the pan, and lift off the parchment paper. Cool cake completely, then wrap <br>
                loosely in waxed paper. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 2 months, <br>
                or in the refrigerator for longer.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This coquito recipe makes a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons <br>
            of coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, <br>
            spices, rum, and, in this version, egg yolks. It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. <br>
            Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself. Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with <br>
            more cinnamon, if desired. Feliz Navidad!<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine evaporated milk and egg yolks in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. <br>
                Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture coats the back of a spoon and reaches <br>
                a temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer mixture to a blender. Add cream of coconut, sweetened condensed milk, rum, water, vanilla, <br>
                cinnamon, and cloves; blend until well combined, about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>Pour into a sterilized glass bottle and refrigerate. Serve over ice, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
